# ADR-0007 Docs as code
Status: Accepted
Date: 2025-09-11

## Context
Complexity is growing; we need persistent, reviewable documentation alongside code.

## Decision
Maintain Markdown docs in `docs/` with Mermaid diagrams; capture key choices as ADRs.

## Consequences
- Easier onboarding and code reviews.
- Lightweight process; update ADRs when choices change.
